  - Create job endpoint: `POST /api/jobs` - Creates new job
  - Update job status: `PATCH /api/jobs/:id/status` - Updates job stage
  - Pipeline stages endpoint: `GET /api/pipeline-stages` - Returns funnel stages
  - Static file serving for frontend
  - 3 test jobs pre-loaded
  - CORS enabled
  - Proper error handling

### 3. API Integration (Completed)
- **Location**: `frontend/src/lib/api.ts`
- **Methods Added**:
  - `updateJobStatus(jobId, status)` - Updates job pipeline stage
  - `getPipelineStages()` - Fetches available pipeline stages
  - Existing methods work: `getJobs()`, `createJob()`, `updateJob()`, `deleteJob()`

### 4. Routing (Completed)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Outstanding Issue: Railway Deployment

### Problem
Railway is serving the frontend as a **static site** instead of running our **Node.js server**.

**Symptoms**:
- `GET /health` returns HTML (index.html) instead of JSON
- `GET /api/jobs` returns HTML (index.html) instead of JSON
- Railway is ignoring all our Node.js server configurations

### What We've Tried
1. ‚úÖ Updated `railway.toml` to use `node server-working.js`
2. ‚úÖ Updated `Procfile` to use `web: node server-working.js`
3. ‚úÖ Updated `railway.json` with explicit start command
4. ‚úÖ Created `nixpacks.toml` to force Node.js build
5. ‚úÖ Removed frontend dist folder
6. ‚úÖ Created minimal Node.js server
7. ‚úÖ Multiple fresh deployments

### Root Cause
Railway appears to be:
- Detecting the frontend build and serving it as a static site
- Ignoring the Node.js server start commands
- Possibly has two services deployed (frontend + backend)
- Or has incorrect service configuration at the Railway dashboard level

### Next Steps to Fix Railway
1. **Check Railway Dashboard**:
   - Verify only ONE service is deployed
   - Check service type (should be "Node.js" not "Static Site")
   - Check build and deploy logs
   - Verify environment variables are set correctly

2. **Alternative Approach**:
   - Deploy backend and frontend as separate services
   - Backend: `server-working.js` on one service
   - Frontend: Build and deploy separately, pointing to backend URL
   - Update CORS settings accordingly

3. **Or Use Different Platform**:
   - Render, Heroku, or Vercel for backend
   - Keep Railway for frontend only

## üéØ What Works Locally

The entire Jobs funnel page works perfectly when running:
```bash
node server-working.js
```

Then visit: `http://localhost:3001`

**All features work**:
- ‚úÖ Jobs display in correct columns
- ‚úÖ Drag and drop between stages
- ‚úÖ Create new jobs
- ‚úÖ Analytics update in real-time
- ‚úÖ Search and filtering
- ‚úÖ Responsive design
- ‚úÖ Error handling

## üìù Files Modified/Created

### Created:
- `server-working.js` - Working combined server
- `server-minimal.js` - Minimal test server
- `nixpacks.toml` - Railway build configuration
- `JOBS_FUNNEL_STATUS.md` - This document

### Modified:
- `frontend/src/App.tsx` - Updated routes to use Jobs funnel
- `frontend/src/pages/Jobs.tsx` - Updated API calls to use new methods
- `frontend/src/lib/api.ts` - Added `updateJobStatus()` and updated methods
- `railway.json` - Updated start command
- `railway.toml` - Updated start command
- `Procfile` - Updated start command

### Built:
- `frontend/dist/` - Production frontend build (built successfully)

## üöÄ Deployment Checklist

When Railway is fixed:
- [ ] Verify `/health` returns JSON: `{"ok": true, "message": "Working combined server running", ...}`
- [ ] Verify `/api/jobs` returns JSON with jobs array
- [ ] Verify `/api/pipeline-stages` returns stages array
- [ ] Open `https://alvap-mvp-production.up.railway.app` in browser
- [ ] Navigate to Jobs page - should show Kanban board
- [ ] Test drag and drop - should move jobs between columns
- [ ] Test creating new job - should appear in "New" column
- [ ] Test analytics - should show correct counts
- [ ] Test on mobile - should be responsive

## üìä Summary

**Jobs Funnel Page: ‚úÖ COMPLETE and READY**
- Frontend: 100% complete
- Backend: 100% complete
- Local testing: 100% working
- Railway deployment: ‚ö†Ô∏è Blocked by configuration issue

The Jobs funnel page is fully built and working. The only issue is getting Railway to run our Node.js server instead of serving the frontend as a static site.
