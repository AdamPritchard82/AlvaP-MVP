# Unit Tests for Business Logic

This directory contains fast, lightweight unit tests that verify our core business rules without touching production data.

## Test Coverage

### 1. Salary Banding Rules (`salary-banding.test.js`)
- **Band calculation**: `salary_min` rounded down to nearest Â£10,000
- **Default salary_max**: +Â£30k when `salary_min < Â£100k`, +Â£50k when `salary_min â‰¥ Â£100k`
- **Band label formatting**: "Â£90,000", "Â£120,000", etc.
- **Edge cases**: Non-numeric, missing, negative values â†’ clear errors, never crash
- **Rounding behavior**: Â£41,250 â†’ Â£40,000, Â£99,999 â†’ Â£90,000

### 2. Skill Handling (`skill-handling.test.js`)
- **Multi-skill support**: Candidates can belong to multiple skills
- **Skill normalization**: Case/whitespace consistent handling
- **Library grouping**: Uses backend-provided skills, never crashes on empty arrays
- **Edge cases**: Null/undefined skills, malformed data
- **All four categories**: Public Affairs, Communications, Policy, Campaigns

### 3. Role-Candidate Matching (`role-matching.test.js`)
- **Skill overlap**: Candidates must share at least one required skill
- **Salary overlap**: Ranges must overlap using same banding logic
- **Scoring algorithm**: 70% skill overlap + 30% salary proximity
- **Empty results**: Returns empty list when no matches, no errors
- **Edge cases**: Null candidates/jobs, empty skill sets

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all unit tests
npm run test:unit

# Expected output:
# ðŸš€ Running Unit Tests for Business Logic
# âœ… All tests passed! Business logic is working correctly.
```

## Test Design Principles

- **Unit-level**: No network calls, no real database
- **Fast**: Run in seconds, stable across environments
- **Deterministic**: Same results every time
- **Isolated**: Don't affect production code paths
- **Readable**: Clear pass/fail messages

## Test Helpers

The `test-helpers.js` file contains pure functions that mirror production business logic:

- `toBandLabel(amount)` - Calculate salary band labels
- `calculateDefaultSalaryMax(salaryMin)` - Default salary max rules
- `normalizeSkill(skill)` - Consistent skill name handling
- `hasSkill(candidateSkills, requiredSkill)` - Skill matching
- `calculateSkillOverlapScore()` - Skill overlap scoring
- `calculateSalaryProximityScore()` - Salary proximity scoring
- `calculateMatchScore(candidate, job)` - Combined match scoring

## What Each Test Suite Validates

### Salary Banding
- âœ… Correct band calculation and rounding
- âœ… Default salary max rules for different salary ranges
- âœ… Proper band label formatting with commas
- âœ… Edge case handling (null, negative, non-numeric)
- âœ… Minimum band enforcement (Â£10,000)

### Skill Handling
- âœ… Multi-skill candidate support
- âœ… Case-insensitive skill matching
- âœ… Skill name normalization
- âœ… All four skill categories working
- âœ… Graceful handling of malformed data

### Role Matching
- âœ… Skill overlap scoring (0-1 scale)
- âœ… Salary proximity scoring with overlap calculation
- âœ… Combined scoring with correct weights (70% skills, 30% salary)
- âœ… Empty result handling (no crashes)
- âœ… Edge cases (null data, empty skill sets)

## Production Safety

These tests:
- âœ… Don't touch production data
- âœ… Don't modify production code paths
- âœ… Don't require database connections
- âœ… Don't make network requests
- âœ… Run in isolation
- âœ… Are deterministic and fast
